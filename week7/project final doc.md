# üìì Banking System - Project Documentation

---

## üîç Problem Statement

A modern banking institution needs a robust, secure, and scalable system to manage various banking operations such as customer onboarding, account management, transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), user authentication, and support ticketing. The system must also maintain historical records for auditing and regulatory compliance.

The goal is to design and implement a comprehensive **Banking System** that enables seamless interaction between customers, staff, and banking services, while ensuring data integrity, traceability, and ease of management.

## üìà ER Diagram

The system is modeled with 36 tables in total:
- **20 application tables** for customer, account, transactions, etc.
- **6 Celery-related tables** for background task processing.
- **10 Django internal tables** for admin, auth, sessions, etc.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

This section previously included terminal commands for deploying the application using Docker and Kubernetes. For clarity and simplicity, we are presenting a high-level overview of the deployment steps:

### Deployment Flow Overview

1. **Docker Image Preparation**
   - Login to DockerHub
   - Build and tag the Docker image
   - Push the image to DockerHub repository

2. **Run the Application Locally with Docker**
   - Run the backend (Django) and frontend (React) containers
   - Ensure services are accessible via browser (localhost ports)

3. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup with Minikube**
   - Start/reset Minikube cluster
   - Deploy Kubernetes manifests (YAML files)
   - Expose services and verify pods

4. **Monitoring Stack Installation**
   - Create a dedicated monitoring namespace
   - Deploy Redis Exporter
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana
   - Port-forward services for local access

5. **Access Services via Browser**
   - Access NodePort, Prometheus, and Grafana UIs

## üîß Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Tools Used
- **Docker**: Containerization of app components.
- **Kubernetes**: Cluster orchestration for scaling and reliability.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation.
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection.
- **Grafana**: Dashboard visualization of metrics.
