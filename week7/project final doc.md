# üìì Banking System - Project Documentation

---

## üîç Problem Statement

A modern banking institution needs a robust, secure, and scalable system to manage various banking operations such as customer onboarding, account management, transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), user authentication, and support ticketing. The system must also maintain historical records for auditing and regulatory compliance.

The goal is to design and implement a comprehensive **Banking System** that enables seamless interaction between customers, staff, and banking services, while ensuring data integrity, traceability, and ease of management.

## üìä ER Diagram

The system is modeled with 36 tables in total:
- **20 application tables** for customer, account, transactions, etc.
- **6 Celery-related tables** for background task processing.
- **10 Django internal tables** for admin, auth, sessions, etc.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Login to DockerHub
```bash
docker login
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t bankingsystem .
```

### Step 3: Run Docker Container
```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 3000:3000 --name banking-system bankingsystem
```

### Step 4: If Container Already Exists, Remove It
```bash
docker rm -f banking-system
```

### Step 5: Check Service Endpoints
- Django: http://localhost:8000
- Metrics: http://localhost:8000/metrics
- React: http://localhost:3000

### Step 6: Tag & Push Docker Image

docker tag <image_name> <your_dockerhub_username>/bankingsystem:v1
docker push <your_dockerhub_username>/bankingsystem:v1
```

### Step 7: Reset & Start Minikube
```bash
minikube delete
minikube start
```

### Step 8: Deploy Kubernetes Resources
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl get pods
```

### Step 9: Create Monitoring Namespace
```bash
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

### Step 10: Port-Forward Django and React Services
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/django-service 8000:8000
kubectl port-forward svc/react-service 3000:3000
```

### Step 11: Port-Forward Redis Exporter
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/redis-exporter 9121:9121
```

### Step 12: Deploy Prometheus
```bash
kubectl apply -f prometheus/
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus -n monitoring 9090:9090
```

### Step 13: Deploy Grafana
```bash
kubectl apply -f Grafana/
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana -n monitoring 3030:3000
```

### Step 14: Get Node Info and Service Details
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get services
```

### Step 15: Access the Application
- NodePort example: `http://<node-ip>:30008`
- Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3030`
