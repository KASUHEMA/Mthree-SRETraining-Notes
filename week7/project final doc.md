# üìì Banking System - Project Documentation

---

## üîç Problem Statement

A modern banking institution needs a robust, secure, and scalable system to manage various banking operations such as customer onboarding, account management, transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), user authentication, and support ticketing. The system must also maintain historical records for auditing and regulatory compliance.

The goal is to design and implement a comprehensive **Banking System** that enables seamless interaction between customers, staff, and banking services, while ensuring data integrity, traceability, and ease of management.

- **20 application tables** for customer, account, transactions, etc.
- **6 Celery-related tables** for background task processing.
- **10 Django internal tables** for admin, auth, sessions, etc.
